#DES Algorithm
--------------------------
1. Learn the basic details of DES for the exam 
  - Why DES is considered insecure nowadays?
  - What is the key length? - key size if 56 bits? 
  - Why is bits? - because it makes it easier to be applied in hardware.
2. High-Level Overview of Des
  - What is a symmetric Cypher? You have to talk about the keys, you have to say that we use a single key to encrypt and decrypt (SAME key)
  - What we define as a block cypher? (Here you have to remember that we try to break the message into a series of blocks - and in each block we have encryption and decryption)
  - What is the DES block size? (64 bits)
  - Important encryption operations (2) - Confussion and Diffusion (YOU HAVE TO KNOW THIS REALLY WELL, 100% THA EINAI MESA)
    -> Kata to confussion i shesi tou kleidiou mazi me to teliko apotelesma ( to ciphertext mas) allazei. Και πως επιτυγχάνεται αυτό ? Μέσω του substitution.!
    -> Κατά το diffusion, το τι συμβαίνει είναι ότι η αλλαγή σε ένα σύμβολο τότε μπορεί να έχει μεγάλη επιρροή σε όλο το ciphertext. Kρύβει ουσιαστικά την πιθανότητα να κατανοήσουμε στατιστικά το ciphertext.
       Επιτυγχάνεται με την χρήση του permutation (ένα παράδειγμα αν θυμηθούμε είναι το transposition cipher)

-> We have rounds of Diffusion and Confussions that lead to the product ciphers.
   - How many rounds we have in DES and what is special about it? - We have 16 rounds in DES and in each one we are using a different key (but be careful this is not the initial key!)
   - What is avalanche effect in Cryptography? alanche effect is considered as one of the desirable property of any encryption algorithm. A slight change in either the key or the plain-text 
     should result in a significant change in the cipher-text. This property is termed as avalanche effect.  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avalanche-effect-in-cryptography/

Slide 12,12 -> Very important overall -> Key scheduling = θα μας φτιάξει 15 rounds. + initial key.

-> Explain a feistel network in a nutshell = Please know how to draw this, it has been asked before.
